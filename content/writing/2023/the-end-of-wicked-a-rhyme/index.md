Man's becoming more corrupt now, godless, wicked, and cruel<br/>
The soulless man stood silenced, their empty promises rang so true<br/>
Lust and power, indulgence, no fear left with his sins, how does this end?<br/>
Chastisement worse than the flood, spread the word, it's all through<br/>
As if we haven't swam enough in this life of misery<br/>
We won't be here tomorrow, hold on to me for one last time<br/>

As the prophets shed the light on what's to come, the crowds gather and ask when is its arrival?<br/>
None but your Lord can reveal as to when it will occur<br/>
Only, all of a sudden will it come to you, it is heavy in the heavens and the earth<br/>
Your time is precious, they explained<br/>

When the Earth will be shaken violently,<br/>
Every nursing mother will forget her nursling,<br/>
Every pregnant female will miscarry,<br/>
Sky will split asunder,<br/>
And the commanded angels will bear the Throne of your Lord<br/>
Don't go to sleep tonight, darling, hold me in your arms<br/>
These will be our final days and I can't let go<br/>

_This rhyme was inspired by "The Wick** End &mdash; Aven\*\*d Sevenf\*\*d"._
