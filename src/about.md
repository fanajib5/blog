Hi! I'm **Faiq Najib** (also known as fanajib5), a backend developer who mostly uses Go for work. Currently, my main task is converting PHP (CodeIgniter 3 and Laravel) to Go, as well as converting MySQL to PostgreSQL.

This is my personal blog where I write about programming, technology, and random things that interest me.

Previously hosted on Hugo, now migrated to Eleventy with a modern frontend stack.
